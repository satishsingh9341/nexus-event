# Smart Event Management System - Hack2Skill MVP
**Repository Size Constraint < 1MB Edition**

This is the strictly optimized, dependency-free prototype for the Hack2Skill challenge.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Organizing large-scale college and corporate events leads to massive bottlenecks at entry gates, chaotic seating arrangements, and inefficient food distribution where unauthorized people consume resources while valid hackers might be left starving. 

## 💡 Solution Approach
We built **NexusEvent**, an ultra-lightweight offline-capable management system. 
To comply with the Hack2Skill minimum size constraint and zero heavy-framework rules, this MVP is entirely executed in the browser utilizing Vanilla JS and DOM manipulation, eliminating `node_modules` and saving 100+ MBs of boilerplate.

## 🛠 Features & How It Works
- **Zero Dependencies:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS. Tailwind and QRCode are pulled via lightweight CDNs.
- **Student Node (QR Mode):** Upon login, students get an instant dynamic QR code bound to their identity. Their seat is instantly generated upon entry, preventing crowding.
- **Admin Command Center:** Real-time log tracking. Simulating optical scans increments live metrics.
- **Smart Fuel Tracking:** Demonstrates exact batch processing metrics so food lines never exceed 15 people.

## 📌 Assumptions Made
1. **Database:** Operations have been mocked locally in memory to respect the "Zero backend requirement/Lightweight execution" constraints for MVP testing. 
2. **Scanner Hardware:** The simulation button replicates what an actual volunteer's mobile web-cam query would hit via `/api/scan`.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally 
1. Open this directory.
2. Double click `index.html`.
3. The app is ready immediately. Switch to dark mode for the premium "Cyber" aesthetic. 

*No servers, no NPM installations, zero configuration necessary.*
